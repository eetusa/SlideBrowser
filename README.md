# SlideBrowser
A tool to browse PDF & PPT files and search pages by text (and display them all conviniently at the same time).

Uses [this](https://github.com/eetusa/PPT-PDF-parser) to parse pages and text content from the PDF&PPT files.
## Usage
Run the software and open the folder where you have your ppt/pdf-files. Supports multiple folders opened a the same time.
## Known bugs
Problems with spaces in folder paths. Problems with " marks (quotes) in pdf or ppt files. Fixing these are pretty trivial, but haven't done it.
The bugs are both in the java-subproject that deso the pdf/ppt handling.
