#SlideBrowser
A tool to browse PDF & PPT-files and search pages by text (and display them all conviniently at the same time).
##Usage
Run the software and open the folder where you have your ppt/pdf-files. Supports multiple folders opened a the same time.
##Known bugs
Problems with spaces in folder paths. Problems with " marks (quotes) in pdf or ppt files. Fixing these are pretty trivial, but haven't done it.
The bugs are both in the java-subprojects that do the pdf/ppt handling. The electron app just calls the java program.
